v0.16.0
Major overhaul of the detection algorithms!
* Much more reliable detection of screens means the dreaded [undetected] match result is now pretty unlikely
* Faster detection of victory & defeat means HearthStats.net Uploader should still catch the result even when immediately dismiss your crushing defeat
* Rank detection is more reliable and should detect higher ranks without trouble (not legendary yet, though?)
* A small increase in the speed of detection
