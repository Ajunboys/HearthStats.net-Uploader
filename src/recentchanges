If you're coming from v0.11.x you will need
to manually download the new file from 
http://goo.gl/8NlWBX due to an upgrade bug 
in that release. Apologies.

v0.12.2013020101
* Detection and notification of your turn
* Tracking and submission of number of turns in match
* Tracking and submission of match duration in seconds

You may need to launch HearthStats.exe 
manually after this update.
